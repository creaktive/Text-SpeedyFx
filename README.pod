Text::SpeedyFx - tokenize/hash large amount of strings efficiently

=head1 VERSION

version 0.006

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Dumper;
    use Text::SpeedyFx;

    my $sfx = Text::SpeedyFx->new;

    my $words_bag = $sfx->hash('To be or not to be?');
    print Dumper $words_bag;
    #$VAR1 = {
    #          '1422534433' => '1',
    #          '4120516737' => '2',
    #          '1439817409' => '2',
    #          '3087870273' => '1'
    #        };

    my $feature_vector = $sfx->hash_fv("thats the question", 8);
    print unpack('b*', $feature_vector);
    # 01001000

=head1 DESCRIPTION

XS implementation of a very fast combined parser/hasher which works well on a variety of I<bag-of-word> problems.

L<Original implementation|http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2008/HPL-2008-91R1.pdf> is in Java and was adapted for a better Unicode compliance.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new([$seed, $bits])

Initialize parser/hasher, can be customized with the options:

=over 4

=item C<$seed>

Hash seed (default: 1).

=item C<$bits>

How many bits do represent one character.
The default value, 8, sacrifices Unicode handling but is fast and low on memory footprint.
The value of 18 encompasses I<Basic Multilingual>, I<Supplementary Multilingual> and I<Supplementary Ideographic> planes.

=back

=head2 hash($string)

Parses C<$string> and returns a hash reference where keys are the hashed tokens and values are their respective count.
Note that this is the slowest form due to the (computational) complexity of the Perl hash structure itself:
C<hash_fv()> is up to 400% faster, while C<hash_min()> is up to 420% faster.

=head2 hash_fv($string, $n)

Parses C<$string> and returns a feature vector (string of bits) with length C<$n>.
C<$n> is supposed to be a multiplier of 8, as the length of the resulting feature vector is C<ceil($n / 8)>.
See the included utilities L<cosine_sim> and L<uniq_wc>.

=head2 hash_min($string)

Parses C<$string> and returns the hash with the lowest value.
Useful in L<MinHash|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash> implementation.
See also the included L<minhash_cmp> utility.
