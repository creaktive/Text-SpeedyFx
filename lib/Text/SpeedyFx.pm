    use Data::Dumper;
    use Text::SpeedyFx;

    my $sfx = Text::SpeedyFx->new;

    my $words_bag = $sfx->hash('To be or not to be?');
    print Dumper $words_bag;
    #$VAR1 = {
    #          '1422534433' => '1',
    #          '4120516737' => '2',
    #          '1439817409' => '2',
    #          '3087870273' => '1'
    #        };

    my $feature_vector = $sfx->hash_fv("thats the question", 8);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

XS implementation of a very fast combined parser/hasher which works well on a variety of I<bag-of-word> problems.

L<Original implementation|http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2008/HPL-2008-91R1.pdf> is in Java and was adapted for a better Unicode compliance.

=head1 UNICODE SUPPORT

Due to the nature of Perl, Unicode support is handled differently from the original implementation.
By default, L<Text::SpeedyFx> recognizes UTF-8 encoded code points in the range I<00000-2FFFF>:

=for :list
* B<Plane 0>, the B<Basic Multilingual Plane> (BMP, I<0000–FFFF>)
* B<Plane 1>, the B<Supplementary Multilingual Plane> (SMP, I<10000–1FFFF>)
* B<Plane 2>, the B<Supplementary Ideographic Plane> (SIP, I<20000–2FFFF>)
* There are planes up to 16; however, as in Perl v5.16.2, there are no code points matching C<isALNUM_utf8()> there (so it's irrelevant for proper algorithm operation).

Although, there is a major drawback: in this mode, B<each instance> allocates up to 1 MB of memory.

If the application doesn't need to support code points beyond the B<Plane 0>
(like the original SpeedyFx implementation) it is possible to constraint the address space to 16 bits, which lowers memory allocation to up to 256 KB.
In fact, L<Text::SpeedyFx> constructor accepts bit range between 8 and 18 to address code points.

=head2 LATIN-1 SUPPORT

8 bit address space has one special meaning: it completely disables multibyte support.
In 8 bit mode, each instance will only allocate 256 bytes and hashing will run up to 340% faster!
Tokenization will fallback to I<ISO 8859-1 West European languages (Latin-1)> character definitions.

=method new([$seed, $bits])

Initialize parser/hasher, can be customized with the options:

=over 4

=item C<$seed>

Hash seed (default: 1).

=item C<$bits>

How many bits do represent one character.
The default value, 8, sacrifices Unicode handling but is fast and low on memory footprint.
The value of 18 encompasses I<Basic Multilingual>, I<Supplementary Multilingual> and I<Supplementary Ideographic> planes.
See also L</UNICODE SUPPORT>

=back

=method hash($octets)

Parses C<$octets> and returns a hash reference (not exactly; see L</CAVEAT>) where keys are the hashed tokens and values are their respective count.
C<$octets> are assumed to represent UTF-8 string unless L<Text::SpeedyFx> is instantiated with L</$bits> == 8
(which forces Latin-1 mode, see L</UNICODE SUPPORT>).
Note that this is the slowest form due to the (computational) complexity of the L<associative array|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array> data structure itself:
C<hash_fv()>/C<hash_min()> variants are up to 260% faster!

=method hash_fv($octets, $n)

Parses C<$octets> and returns a feature vector (string of bits) with length C<$n>.
C<$n> is supposed to be a multiplier of 8, as the length of the resulting feature vector is C<ceil($n / 8)>.
See the included utilities L<cosine_cmp> and L<uniq_wc>.

=method hash_min($octets)

Parses C<$octets> and returns the hash with the lowest value.
Useful in L<MinHash|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash> implementation.
See also the included L<minhash_cmp> utility.

=head1 BENCHMARK

The test platform configuration:

=for :list
* Intel® Xeon® E5620 CPU @ 2.40GHz (similar to the one cited in the reference paper);
* Debian 6.0.6 (Squeeze, 64-bit);
* Perl v5.16.1 (installed via L<perlbrew>);
* F<enwik8> from the L<Large Text Compression Benchmark|https://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/compression/text.html>.

All the tests except the ones with C<_utf8> suffix were made in L<Latin-1 mode|/UNICODE SUPPORT>.
For comparison, C<murmur_utf8> was implemented using L<Digest::MurmurHash> hasher and native regular expression tokenizer:

    ++$fv->{murmur_hash(lc $1)}
        while $data =~ /(\w+)/gx;

See also the F<eg/benchmark.pl> script.

=head1 CAVEAT

For performance reasons, C<hash()> method returns a L<tied hash|perltie> which is an interface to
L<nedtries|http://www.nedprod.com/programs/portable/nedtries/>.
The interesting property of a L<trie data structure|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie>
is that the keys are "nearly sorted" (and the first key is guaranteed to be the lowest), so:

    # This:
    $fv = $sfx->hash($data);
    ($min) = each %$fv;
    # Is the same as this:
    ($min) = $sfx->hash_min($data);
    # (albeit the later being 2x faster)

The downside is the magic involved, the C<delete> breaking the key order, and the memory usage.
The hardcoded limit is 524288 unique keys per result, which consumes ~25MB of RAM on a 64-bit architecture.
Exceeding this will C<croak> with the message I<"too many unique tokens in a single data chunk">.
The only way to raise this limit is by recompilation of the XS module:

    perl Makefile.PL DEFINE=-DMAX_TRIE_SIZE=2097152
    make
    make test
    make install
